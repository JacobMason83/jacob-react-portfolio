            <p>Hello, I am Jacob Mason and i am a graduate of Bottega University Full Stack Web Development Certification Program. 
I am 37 years old, and I am making a career change, into something that i have wanted to do since i first saw the matrix, 
back in 1999. I have always been interested in computers, and how they work, and how websites are build, styled and 
how the data is put onto the page. So back in September of 2020, I made a descision to take a huge risk , and bet it all on
me going back to school fulltime , and hopefully changing my life, and my families life. I want to be able to provide for them, 
like they deserve to be, and web development is a booming industry right now, and it was prime for me to make that change, and switch
careers. Before all of this, I worked in alot of fields trying to find my niche, and I couldent find it until i got into programming. It 
gives me a smile on my face, and an enjoyment that i never thought possible. If I struggle at anything, I work on it until i get it, or if 
its taking me longer, ill take a break and comeback to it, and usually that little break helps. I have worked in the Resturant business, as a 
delivery driver, manager, pizza-maker, a cook , pretty much you name it , i have done it. I also got into the medical field, helping and serving, 
individuals with MRDD , or any developmental disability, and i enjoyed it, and i brought smiles to my individuals faces, but it wasnt what i wanted
either. In 2017 i moved to Indiana to be near my family, and changed scenery from the big city of Toledo OH to near Fort Wayne In. There 
i started free code camps program, but with work, family and other distractions, i could never fully grasp it all. But after i married my
wife in July 11, 2020 , and having a family to support I knew i had to do something, and as I said earlier in September 2020, I made the 
descision to go back to school, and now the rest is history. If you like any of my projects or want to talk about opportunities, 
please email me at neozane23@gmail.com, or you can call or text Monday thru Friday from 9am to 9pm est. I will try and answer if I see the call, it 
may be easier to text me first, and then call . Thanks for taking the time to read my story, and I hope to talk soon. <br />
Thanks <br />
Jacob D Mason</p>
